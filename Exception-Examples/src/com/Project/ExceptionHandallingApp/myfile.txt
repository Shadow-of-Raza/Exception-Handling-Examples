We use SDLC technology to implement the project.
In frontend we use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. 
Firstly mw prepare the documentation of our project. 
And then we implement step by step. Firstly we design 
layout by using Photoshop and then we create a .html file 
for each and every page. In the backend part we use the Java 
programming language to implement the logic and provide 
functionality. We create Databases by using MySQL. 
After that we provide internal connectivity by using 
Advance Java J2EE. In J2EE we use SERVLET to provide 
connectivity in the Frontend and Backend. And We use 
JDBC steps to provide connectivity to Database.
